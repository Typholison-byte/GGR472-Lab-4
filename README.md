# GGR472 Lab 4: Incorporating GIS analysis into web maps using Turf.js
 
This repository contains the starter code required to complete Lab 4. The lab is designed to help you learn how to perform spatial analysis and visualize outputs using the [Turf.js](https://turfjs.org/) and [Mapbox GL JS](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/) libraries.


## Repository Contents
- `data/pedcyc_collision_06-21.geojson`: Data file containing point locations of road collisions involving pedestrian and cyclists between 2006 and 2021 in Toronto 
- `instructions/GGR472_Lab4`: Instructions document explaining steps required to complete the lab
- `index.html`: HTML file to render the map
- `style.css`: CSS file for positioning the map interface
- `script.js`: JavaScript file template to be updated to include code that creates and visualizes and hexgrid map based on the collision data
   

## Elements included

- Used the data file to show the collision spots in Toronto involving pedestrian and cyclists between 2006 and 2021
- Added geocoder and map elements to navigate the map more easily
- Created hexgrid to intersect with collision areas to show better clearly see which areas have the most collisions
- Filter the layers and legend with buttons to turn them off and on
