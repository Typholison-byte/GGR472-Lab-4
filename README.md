# GGR472 Lab 4: Incorporating GIS analysis into web maps using Turf.js

- Used the `data/pedcyc_collision_06-21.geojson` to show the collision spots in Toronto involving pedestrian and cyclists between 2006 and 2021
- Added geocoder and map elements to navigate the map more easily
- Created hexgrid to intersect with collision areas so analyzing certain areas becomes easier visually
- Filter the layers and legend with buttons to turn them off and on
